# Projects

A **project** is any multistep outcome that can be completed within one year. Any commitment within that time frame needs to be reviewed at least weekly.

---

# But really, what are projects

1. It has more than one physical action.
2. Its projected outcome is valuable, desirable, and well articulated.
3. I understand the project’s desirable outcome.
4. I’ve made some kind of commitment (external or internal)[^1].

# What’s the next action?

---

# Actions

An **action** is a physical thing you can do to move a project forward.[^2]

Projects are made of up **actions**. Each project has a **next action**.

Each action has a **context**.

# Contexts

A **context** is the physical or psychological environment within which reminders and information are most effectively sorted for access.

Examples: at home, at the office, high-enegry, at a particular meeting, with a particular person, near a phone, etc.[^3]
